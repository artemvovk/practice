# CS Practice

I practice different algorithms, data structure manipulations, design patterns, etc.

# Setup:

1. Golang 1.11+ with modules
1. All algorithms are run through benchmarks (tests are only for development)
1. Generators are used for randomizing test data
1. Data will include structures, types, and simple structure-related algorithms (hash, push, rebalance, etc.)
