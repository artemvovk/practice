# CS Practice

I practice different algorithms, data structure manipulations, design patterns, etc.

## Setup:

1. Golang 1.11+ with modules
1. Python 3.7.0 for the `/python` scripts
1. All algorithms are run through benchmarks (tests are only for development)
1. Generators are used for randomizing test data
1. Data will include structures, types, and simple structure-related algorithms (hash, push, rebalance, etc.)
