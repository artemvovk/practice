# Servers

Testing out running different types of web servers. The goal is to try/demo/test different protocols, data formats, and other network-related tooling (monitoring, encryption, tracing, DNS, gossip, etc)

There's plenty of libraries that already do all this, but I learn by doing so... Everything is run through benchmarks to test out concurrency. Output is verbose for demo/debugging purposes.

## Protocols:

1. UDP
1. WebSockets
1. RPC (gRPC)
